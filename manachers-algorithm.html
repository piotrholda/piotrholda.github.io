        <h2>What is the Manacher’s Algorithm and how does it work?</h2>
        <p>
            Manacher’s algorithm is a method for determining the longest palindrome in a given string of characters. The
            algorithm takes advantage of the fact that palindromes are symmetric to reduce the number of comparisons
            required to find the longest palindrome in a string.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s take an example string: “ababdedbabeab”. The longest palindrome in this string is “babdedbab”. Let’s
            mark the center, left, and right boundaries of the palindrome:
        </p>
        <pre>
"ababdedbabeab"
  |   |   |
  L   C   R
        </pre>
        <p>
            Let’s assume that each element of the sequence is the middle of some palindrome, even if it is a palindrome
            consisting of one element. We will create an array in which we will record the distance from each center to
            the boundary of the palindrome:
        </p>
        <pre>
"ababdedbabeab"
"0110040011000"
  |   |   |
  L   C   R
        </pre>
        <p>
            We can notice that by its nature, a palindrome is symmetrical about its center. If a palindrome contains
            other palindromes, symmetry means that the arrangement of these inner palindromes is also symmetrical. This
            observation means that if we find a smaller palindrome inside a larger palindrome on the left side of its
            center, we can speed up the search for the palindrome on the right side because we know that it will have
            the same or greater length.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manacher’s Algorithm looks for palindromes containing an odd number of characters. We can easily bypass this
            limitation with a simple trick. We will add a ‘#’ character at the beginning, end, and between the
            characters of the string. This ensures that the longest palindrome will have an odd number of characters.
            When we find the longest palindrome, we will ignore these ‘#’ characters.

            See the implementation in Java. The comments will help you understand how the algorithm works:

        <pre>
public class ManachersAlgorithm {

    static String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        String str = transform(s);
        int length = (2 * s.length()) + 1;
        int[] p = new int[length];
        // The center of the farthest right palindrome found so far.
        int c = 0;
        // The farthest right boundary of a palindrome found so far.
        int r = 0;
        // Length of the longest palindrome found so far.
        int maxLength = 0;
        // Position of the center of the longest palindrome found so far.
        int maxCenter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            /*
                The position of the element lying to the left of center
                at the same distance as the current i.
            */
            int mirror = (2 * c) - i;
            /*
                If we are inside the last found palindrome
                (within it's boundaries), the value of p[i]
                can take the minimum of two values: the distance
                from current i to right boundary or the size of the
                palindrome lying on the mirror side of the last found center.
            */
            if (i < r) {
                p[i] = Math.min(r - i, p[mirror]);
            }
            // Check if we can increase size of the current palindrome
            int tempL = i - (1 + p[i]);
            int tempR = i + (1 + p[i]);
            while (tempL >= 0 && tempR < length
                    && str.charAt(tempL) == str.charAt(tempR)) {
                p[i]++;
                tempL--;
                tempR++;
            }
            /*
                Check if the palindrome at i is expanding beyond
                the current right boundary of the palindrome at center c.
                If it is, the new center is i and the new r is
                the right boundary of the palindrome at i.
            */
            if (i + p[i] > r) {
                c = i;
                r = i + p[i];

                if (p[i] > maxLength) {
                    maxLength = p[i];
                    maxCenter = i;
                }
            }
        }
        return extractSubstring(s, maxLength, maxCenter);
    }

    private static String transform(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            sb.append("#");

                                           int maxCenter) {
        int l = (maxCenter - maxLength) / 2;

        <p>
            Manacher’s algorithm uses palindrome symmetry to avoid character re-checking and efficiently uses previously
            computed information. Thanks to this, it achieves a linear time complexity of O(N), where N is the length of
            the input string. This makes it a very efficient algorithm for solving the problem of finding the longest
            palindrome in a string.
