        <p>
            When using Postman with an access token-secured website, you’ve probably encountered an annoying problem. You need to call the endpoint to refresh the token:
        </p>
        <img src="automatically-refreshing-access-token-in-postman-1.png">
        <p>
            Then you need to copy the token returned by the endpoint and manually paste it into the request you want to execute:
        </p>

       <h2>How to refresh a token without copying it manually?</h2>
        <p>
            Postman offers the functionality of user-defined variables. You can find them in the Environments tab. Let’s define a global variable:
        </p>
        <img src="automatically-refreshing-access-token-in-postman-3.png">
        <p>
            Then, in the token refresh request, we need to add JavaScript code that will retrieve the token from the response and save it to our variable:
        </p>
        <pre>
const response = pm.response.json();
pm.globals.set("token",response.token);
        </pre>
        <p>
            You can add this code in the Tests tab:
        </p>
        <img src="automatically-refreshing-access-token-in-postman-4.png">
        <p>
            Now we can test the operation of this script. Hit Send and see if your variable received a new value:
        </p>

        <p>
            The last step is to use the token to authenticate other requests. Variables can be used with double curly brackets:
        </p>
        <pre>
{{test}}
        </pre>
        <p>
            Use it in the Authentication tab, hit Send, and see if your token works as expected:
        </p>
